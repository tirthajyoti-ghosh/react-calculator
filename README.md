# React Calculator

## Milestone-3 - Styled components

* Used flex display mode for App, Display and ButtonPanel components
    * The Calculator width is 700px.
* Style the Display component
    * It has a gray background.
    * It has a height set to 100px.
    * The result is presented with a white and bold text.
    * The result has padding from the edges.
    * The result is aligned to the right.
* Styled the ButtonPanel component
    * Each row (display and group buttons) has a height of 100 px.
    * The Button groups is displayed horizontally in rows.
* Styled the Button component
    * Button should take 25% of the container width, except for the button that represents the “0” (zero).
    * The text in the buttons is centered and displayed in black color.
    * Each button has a border.
* Passed “color” and “wide” props to the Button
    * The `color` prop is used to customize the color of the button. If it is not passed, the button has an orange background by default.
    * The `wide` prop accepts a boolean to indicate that the button has twice the standard width (used for the “0” button).
